What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialized a new hidden folder called the .git is created which stores all the metadata regarding the files in the repository.We need to do it so that we can use git commands 
on the files in the repository and thereby keep track of the files in it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a temporary space where one puts all the files changed.Working directory is the space where all the changes to the files are made.The repository is the final destination of the changed files with meaningfull commit messages for each logical changes made.
Staging helps one split up one large change into multiple commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
We can commit each files separately with separate commit messages.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Some situations like a new experimental feature being added to the codebase,changing the language of the application suited to a particular region,etc.
Branch would help because these features may not be a success and the application would needed to be used in the previous mode,or these maybe a success and may need to be incorporated in the main codebase.There also might be a bug in the master branch which can be resolved using branches.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
We can verify which commits are reachable at which branch and if some commits are lost.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The result of merging two branches is combining the changes made in both the branches in the codebae.To visualize it to understand it better.
