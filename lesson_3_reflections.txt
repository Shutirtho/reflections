When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I would want to collaborate with other developers.Or when I would want to showcase my work to potential employers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The changes might not be complete and meaningfull.The changes might be conflicting with changes in the local repository.
